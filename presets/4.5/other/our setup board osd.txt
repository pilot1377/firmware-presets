#$ DESCRIPTION: ZoeFPV 3D setup and tunes
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br /><br />
#$ DESCRIPTION: This preset has everything you need for a smooth 3D flying experience, no longer guess if you have BetaFlight setup right! Includes my legendary rate profile that I’ve used for years, along with 2 variations of it depending on your own style and feel, plus KittFPV’s rates for a more linear and locked in experience.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Each rate has been tested for it’s ability to do chaotic 3D manoeuvres, and for tight tic-tocs.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: Included PID Presets are for 4s, on a Unicorn airframe, running 2208-1950kv motors. Should work with any well made frame in good condition. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Have been tested on 2207-2450kv motors. 
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: Will add 5s and 6s tune to this preset in the near future. And yes this has airmode on and should be kept on.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Also there is a ‘reset’ option to remove the 3D settings in the 3D setup.
